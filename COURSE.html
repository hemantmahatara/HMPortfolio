                            "Excited to share my comprehensive HEC-RAS project journey! 🌊 .For the data I started by
                            digitizing point data in Google Earth Pro, followed by importing it into ArcGIS for TIN
                            generation. Utilized this TIN in RASMapper to digitize river geometry such as centerline,
                            edge,and flow area. Then, conducted steady flow analysis to simulate steady flood scenarios
                            in my study area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Steady flow analysis in HEC-RAS is crucial for hydraulic modeling as it helps predict water
                            flow patterns, velocities, and inundation extents under steady-state conditions. This
                            analysis is
                            vital for flood modeling, risk assessment, and infrastructure planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HEC-RAS, or Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, is a powerful tool widely
                            used in engineering, environmental science, and disaster management. Its potential spans
                            from hydraulic modeling for river systems, floodplain management, bridge and culvert design,
                            to
                            assessing environmental impacts of hydraulic structures. In disaster management, HEC-RAS
                            plays a pivotal role in predicting flood extents, facilitating evacuation planning, and
                            guiding
                            flood mitigation efforts.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am excited about the numerous applications of HEC-RAS and eager to continue researching its
                            potential in improving engineering solutions and disaster resilience.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔹 Textbox & Button: Users can type a district name and click a button to clip the specific
                            district road network. <br>
                            🔹 FastAPI & PostgreSQL/PostGIS Integration: The FastAPI is triggered, which directly
                            queries the PostgreSQL PostGIS database to clip the road network of the selected district.
                            <br>
                            🔹 Real-time Display: The clipped road network is then dynamically displayed on the webpage.
                            <br>
                            🔹 API Testing: Successfully tested the API using Postman, ensuring it accurately fetches
                            the specific district roads. <br>

                            🌿 Exciting news from the field of geospatial science! 🗺I am excited to present the results
                            of my most recent project: a thorough Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map of Kaski District,
                            Nepal. 🏞️ By utilizing supervised classification techniques in conjunction with Sentinel
                            satellite data, which has an amazing 10-meter resolution, I have produced a map that depicts
                            details of the local topography.🛰️🌍🛰️🌍
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            🔍 To ensure accuracy, I meticulously collected training samples for 11 distinct land cover
                            categories using Google Earth Pro. These samples were then used to train the classification
                            algorithm, enabling it to accurately classify pixels across the entire study area. 📊
                            Supervised classification involves the use of labelled training data to guide the
                            classification process, resulting in more precise and interpretable results compared to
                            unsupervised methods. 💡 By providing the algorithm with examples of each land cover class,
                            we can ensure that the final LULC map accurately reflects the true characteristics of the
                            landscape.

                            suitability analysis for Kaski District in Nepal! Utilizing advanced GIS techniques, I
                            employed a weighted overlay tool to integrate various parameters including slope, elevation,
                            land use/land cover (LULC), soil moisture, distance from river, aspect, and distance from
                            road.

                            By leveraging this multidimensional approach, we were able to identify optimal areas for
                            agriculture, empowering local communities with data-driven insights to enhance agricultural

                            management.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) provides high-resolution, all-weather imaging, while
                            Sentinel-1, part of the European Space Agency's Copernicus program, offers continuous
                            monitoring capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>Analysing the interferometry gives the insist knowledge about any activity that could happen
                            due to the displacement of the ground. Using Doppler Frequency Shift, we can measure how
                            much and in which direction the movement of ground occurs. Some of the analyses due to the
                            use of interferometry are earthquake deformation on land, flood monitoring, landslide
                            monitoring, ground coverage movement, etc. It is a pretty cool thing which gives precise
                            information about any of the ground deformations.🛰📡🌐💡</p>

            <h1>Schematic Diagram of How my GPS Device and MeroBus Works</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                The Mero Bus application works by utilizing a custom-built GPS tracking device installed on public
                buses, which continuously gathers real-time location data (latitude and longitude) and sends it to a
                backend server via HTTP requests over a cellular network. <br> <br>
                This data is then processed and stored in a
                PostgreSQL database. The app's frontend, developed in React JS, retrieves this data through REST APIs
                and displays the live location of buses on an interactive map using Leaflet.js. The integration of
                WebSocket ensures real-time updates without requiring page refreshes, providing users with a seamless
                and accurate view of bus movements, thus enhancing the overall public transportation experience.
