                            "Excited to share my comprehensive HEC-RAS project journey! üåä .For the data I started by
                            digitizing point data in Google Earth Pro, followed by importing it into ArcGIS for TIN
                            generation. Utilized this TIN in RASMapper to digitize river geometry such as centerline,
                            edge,and flow area. Then, conducted steady flow analysis to simulate steady flood scenarios
                            in my study area.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Steady flow analysis in HEC-RAS is crucial for hydraulic modeling as it helps predict water
                            flow patterns, velocities, and inundation extents under steady-state conditions. This
                            analysis is
                            vital for flood modeling, risk assessment, and infrastructure planning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            HEC-RAS, or Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System, is a powerful tool widely
                            used in engineering, environmental science, and disaster management. Its potential spans
                            from hydraulic modeling for river systems, floodplain management, bridge and culvert design,
                            to
                            assessing environmental impacts of hydraulic structures. In disaster management, HEC-RAS
                            plays a pivotal role in predicting flood extents, facilitating evacuation planning, and
                            guiding
                            flood mitigation efforts.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am excited about the numerous applications of HEC-RAS and eager to continue researching its
                            potential in improving engineering solutions and disaster resilience.</p>

                            of my most recent project: a thorough Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) map of Kaski District,
                            Nepal. üèûÔ∏è By utilizing supervised classification techniques in conjunction with Sentinel
                            satellite data, which has an amazing 10-meter resolution, I have produced a map that depicts
                            details of the local topography.üõ∞Ô∏èüåçüõ∞Ô∏èüåç
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            üîç To ensure accuracy, I meticulously collected training samples for 11 distinct land cover
                            categories using Google Earth Pro. These samples were then used to train the classification
                            algorithm, enabling it to accurately classify pixels across the entire study area. üìä
                            Supervised classification involves the use of labelled training data to guide the
                            classification process, resulting in more precise and interpretable results compared to
                            unsupervised methods. üí° By providing the algorithm with examples of each land cover class,
                            we can ensure that the final LULC map accurately reflects the true characteristics of the
                            landscape.

            <h1>Schematic Diagram of How my GPS Device and MeroBus Works</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
                The Mero Bus application works by utilizing a custom-built GPS tracking device installed on public
                buses, which continuously gathers real-time location data (latitude and longitude) and sends it to a
                backend server via HTTP requests over a cellular network. <br> <br>
                This data is then processed and stored in a
                PostgreSQL database. The app's frontend, developed in React JS, retrieves this data through REST APIs
                and displays the live location of buses on an interactive map using Leaflet.js. The integration of
                WebSocket ensures real-time updates without requiring page refreshes, providing users with a seamless
                and accurate view of bus movements, thus enhancing the overall public transportation experience.
