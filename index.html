            <img src="./hemant.jpg" alt="Hemant Kumar Mahatara" class="profile-photo">
            <p>I am a dedicated Geomatics Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in GIS, remote sensing, drone
                surveying, and data analysis. My diverse experiences range from technical roles to leadership positions,
                including serving as the President of the Geomatics Engineering Students Association of Nepal (GESAN),
                where I led numerous programs focused on open mapping and GIS training. I possess hands-on skills in
                surveying techniques using theodolites, total stations, DGPS, and LiDAR, and I have a deep understanding
                of how to apply geospatial data in various fields, including disaster risk reduction, environmental
                modeling, and urban planning.

                Throughout my career, I have worked on innovative projects such as the development of a real-time GPS
                tracking system, flood and landslide prediction models, and water quality assessments. My technical
                expertise extends to programming with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Python, and database management,
                which I have applied in Web GIS development and creating user-friendly applications for geospatial data
                visualization.

                Currently working as an Urban Data Associate at NAXA Pvt. Ltd., I lead metric house numbering projects
                in several municipalities, demonstrating my skills in technical leadership, public speaking, and coding.
                My goal is to integrate my geomatics knowledge with real-world applications to contribute to sustainable
                development and disaster resilience. I am passionate about using geospatial technology to drive positive
                change in communities and look forward to leveraging my skills in future endeavors.

                <p>As the President of the Geomatics Engineering Students' Association of Nepal (GESAN) since August
                    2022, I have led a dedicated team in organizing impactful workshops, training sessions, and
                    competitions, including advanced topics like ArcGIS, QGIS, WebGIS, and Google Earth Engine. My focus
                    has been on equipping our members with practical skills while fostering collaboration and innovation
                    within the geomatics community. As President, my goal has been to inspire and empower the next
                    generation of geomatics engineers by providing them with the tools, resources, and support they need
                    to succeed. I am proud of the progress we have made as a team and look forward to continuing to
                    contribute to the growth and development of the geomatics community in Nepal.</p>

                <p>As a dedicated volunteer with the Young Water Volunteer initiative, I actively contributed to water
                    quality testing in the Pokhara-Lekhnath Metropolitan City. My role involved assessing key water
                    quality parameters such as pH, acidity, turbidity, and other critical factors essential for
                    determining water safety. Through meticulous testing and analysis, I evaluated multiple water
                    reservoirs, tanks, and other water sources within the locality, providing crucial insights into
                    their suitability for drinking. This experience allowed me to directly address community health
                    concerns by identifying water sources that met safe drinking standards and highlighting those that
                    required further treatment or should be avoided. </p>
